# GameOfLife
A program to simulate John Conway's Game of Life. 

Made in Python using tKinter for the graphical interface, users are able to individually interact with cells to create unique patterns, randomly populate the board or clear it entirely.

Once a pattern or design is ready to go, you can step the game one generation at a time, giving the opportunity to reflect on the changes happening gradually.

Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜„
